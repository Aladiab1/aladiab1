👋 Hi, I’m Ala Diab! I’m a final-year Software Engineering student at the University of Salford, on track for a First Class Honours.

👀 I’m passionate about cloud engineering, DevOps, and full-stack development, with a strong interest in building scalable systems and applying modern software engineering practices.

🌱 Currently working with Java, Python, SQL, and PHP, while also building expertise in AWS services, Terraform, and Agile delivery through both university projects and industry experience.

💻 I have hands-on experience designing AWS data pipelines and creating interactive dashboards in QuickSight, as well as developing full-stack web applications using PHP, JavaScript, and SQLite.

🔧 Comfortable with tools such as Git, Linux, VS Code, and Eclipse, and always looking to deepen my knowledge of cloud platforms, infrastructure-as-code, and automation.

🚀 Excited to contribute to projects involving cloud solutions, software engineering, or DevOps, and eager to grow in a collaborative, innovative environment.

🎯 Looking for a graduate role starting in 2025 where I can apply my technical skills, learn from experienced professionals, and continue developing my career in cloud and software engineering.

🌍 Enthusiastic about continuous learning, keeping up with industry trends, and pushing myself to deliver high-quality, impactful solutions.
